# Bash



* _Redirection_ reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error.
* The common redirection commands are:
  * `>` redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.
  * `>>` redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.
  * `<` redirects standard input to a command.
  * `|` redirects standard output of a command to another command.
* A number of other commands are powerful when combined with redirection commands:
  * `sort`: sorts lines of text alphabetically.
  * `uniq`: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.
  * `grep`: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.
  * `sed` : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.
