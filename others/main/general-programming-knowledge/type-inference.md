# Type inference

Type inference is the automatic deduction of the data types of specific expressions in a programming language, usually done at compile time.

In this case we  can see that TypeScript has deduced that `x` is a number, without telling that `x` is a number.

If we have various data types TypeScript will put the type of this data types on it.

Here TypeScript has assigned to this variable that is an array where we can have a string, number or an object with one entry called key that it's a string.
