# Additions to HTML5

HTML5 allows us to insert multimedia in the page with the tags `audio` and `video`, in HTML4 if you want to add audio or video you need to relay in third party plugins such as flash or Silverlight, now you can integrate multimedia directly thanks to the built in plugin in the browser.

Web APIs, let us to interact with a lot of tools such as the sensors of a phone \(gyroscopic, light, etc.\) or the geolocation with this built in API in the browser.

In HTML4 the only way that you could store data in the browser was in his cache, even the cache is a fast memory, it's downside is that is so small, so we can't store a lot of data, with HTML5 this has changed, thanks to the WebStorage API we can store larger amounts of data in the browser thanks to the Local Storage and the SessionStorage.

We can have a full duplex connection via WebSockets in HTML5, in HTML4 we couldn't do a full duplex connection because there wasn't WebSockets.

HTML5 introduced a lot of new elements, and this make place to the Semantic HTML, this semantic html lets us to better separate the parts of the page in order to have a better organization and a better handling of the screen readers, some of these elements are`section, nav, header, article, aside, footer, etc.`
