# FlexBox



1. `display: flex` changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.
2. `display: inline-flex` allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.
3. `justify-content` is used to space items along the main axis.
4. **`align-items` is used to space items along the cross axis.**
5. `flex-grow` is used to specify how much space \(and in what proportions\) flex items absorb along the main axis.
6. `flex-shrink` is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what proportions along the main axis.
7. `flex-basis` is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with `flex-grow` and/or `flex-shrink`.
8. `flex` is used to specify `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` in one declaration.
9. `flex-wrap` specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if the flex container is not large enough.
10. **`align-content` is used to space rows along the cross axis.**
11. `flex-direction` is used to specify the main and cross axes.
12. `flex-flow` is used to specify `flex-wrap` and `flex-direction` in one declaration.
13. Flex containers can be nested inside of each other by declaring `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex` for children of flex containers.
