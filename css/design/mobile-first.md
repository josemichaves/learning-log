# Mobile First

It is the ideology that mobile design, as the hardest, should be done first. Once the mobile design questions are answered, designing for other devices will be easier. What it boils down to is that, the smallest of the designs will have only the essential features, so right away you have designed the heart of your UX.

One caveat, though, is that mobile users sometimes require different content than desktop users. Device-specific content can be gauged by considering context â€” what, in a given situation and a given environment, will your user appreciate more.
